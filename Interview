Have you ever created any certificate ? Yes, through openssl command
The commands below can be used to view the certificate fingerprint/thumbprint.
• SHA-256: openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha256 -inform pem -in [certificate-file.crt] 
• SHA-1: openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha1 -inform pem -in [certificate-file.crt]
• MD5: openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -md5 -inform pem -in [certificate-file.crt] 

What is the demerits and merits while creating a certificate by our own ?
Advantages
1. No PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) is needed.
2. Automatic deployment (Usually Self-signed certificates created automatic during the installation process of the server side applications).
Disadvantages
1. The certificates aren’t trusted by other applications/operating systems. This may lead to authentications errors etc.
Note: To overcome this limitation, some IT staff add the self-signed certificates to the Trusted Roots Certificate Authorities. However, using this workaround may to additional time that needed for management and troubleshooting.
2. Self-signed certificates life time is usually 1 years. Before the year is ended, the certificate may need to renew/replace.
3. Self-signed certificates may use low hash and cipher technologies. Due this, the security level that implemented by self-signed certificates may not satisfy the current Security Policy etc. .
4. No support for advanced PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) functions (e.g. Online checking of the revocation list etc.).
5. Most of the advanced feathers of the server side applications required to impended a PKI (Public Key Infrastructure). By this, self-signed certificates advantages can't be used.
