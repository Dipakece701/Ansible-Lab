Latest Releases Via Pip
Ansible can be installed via “pip”, the Python package manager. If ‘pip’ isn’t already available in your version of Python, you can get pip by:

$ sudo easy_install pip
Then install Ansible with [1]:

$ sudo pip install ansible
Or if you are looking for the latest development version:

pip install git+https://github.com/ansible/ansible.git@devel
If you are installing on OS X Mavericks, you may encounter some noise from your compiler. A workaround is to do the following:

$ sudo CFLAGS=-Qunused-arguments CPPFLAGS=-Qunused-arguments pip install ansible
Readers that use virtualenv can also install Ansible under virtualenv, though we’d recommend to not worry about it and just install Ansible globally. Do not use easy_install to install ansible directly.
